## Introduction

The Cats vs. Dogs dataset is a standard computer vision dataset that contains images of cats and dogs. In this project, instead of using conventional CNNs, we utilize Visual Transformers (ViTs), a relatively new paradigm in computer vision.

## Installation

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+ 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cats-vs-dogs-vit.git
   cd cats-vs-dogs-vit
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

To evaluate the model:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

We achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set using ViTs. Check out the [Jupyter notebook](./results-analysis.ipynb) for a deep dive into the analysis.

| Model           | Accuracy (%) |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Visual Transformer | XX         |
